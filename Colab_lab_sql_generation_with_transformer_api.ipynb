The objective is to assess the model's ability to understand different levels of query complexity and adapt to varying prompt styles.\n","\n","## Methodology:\n","Three distinct prompt versions were crafted, targeting simple data retrieval, conditional queries, and complex multi-table joins. These prompts were tested to determine how accurately the model converted natural language instructions into SQL syntax.\n","\n","## Findings:\n","\n","### Simple Query Conversion:\n","\n","GPT successfully generated accurate SQL for straightforward queries involving single tables. (Result1: SELECT title FROM books WHERE publish_year = 2021;)\n","Strengths: High accuracy in mapping keywords; excellent comprehension of single-table queries.\n","\n","### Complex Queries with Conditions:\n","\n","For queries with filtering conditions, the model generally maintained syntax accuracy but occasionally misinterpreted complex numeric conditions. (Result2: SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE amount > 1000;)\n","Challenges: Misinterpretation in numeric thresholds and using exact table column names without explicit examples.\n","\n","### Multi-table Joins and Advanced Logic:\n","\n","Performance was mixed, with the model capable of producing reasonable JOIN statements but sometimes confusing table relationships and aliases. (Result3: SELECT students.name, enrollments.course FROM students JOIN enrollments ON students.id = enrollments.student_id WHERE enrollments.year = 2020;)\n","Weaknesses: Struggled with multi-step logic and implicit assumptions in natural language.\n","\n","## Conclusion:\n","The experiments demonstrate GPT's robust ability to tackle basic SQL queries with high precision. The model cleverly interprets intent, yet complexity and imprecision in language descriptions lead to inaccuracies. Future efforts can focus on enhancing context understanding and iterative guiding for sophisticated query logic.\n","\n","## Lessons Learned:\n","\n","Prompt Engineering is Crucial: Clear, explicit prompts improve accuracy and relevance of generated queries.\n","Potential for Hallucination: Ambiguous or complex prompts can lead to 'hallucinations'—inaccuracies in logical flow or data relationships.\n","Tool for SQL Learners: Despite imperfections, GPT offers a supportive scaffold for SQL beginners learning to transition natural language to database operations.\n","\n","## Recommendations:\n","\n","Improve prompt phrasing to detail precise relationships for complex queries.\n","Utilize multi-shot learning with examples to enhance GPT's relational understanding.\n","Integrate with error-checking tools for post-generation syntax validation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"ro6jByCTbCWa"},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python
